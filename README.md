Simple and rather straight-forward neovim config file. Without auxilary comments it is nor more than
100 lines. I`m using it for writing Python code (for work) and coding in C (in spare time).

Plugins:
- NERDTree - file manager. I`m using it for so long that even its sturdiness I cannot imagine
  working without it,
- gruvbox color scheme. It is simply the best,
- deoplete.vim + deoplete-jedi. No to feature reach code-completion tool as COC but still great,
- comfortable-motion.vim - eyes would not jump around the file while using this plugin,
- python-syntax - coloring for python files. Works well,
- ale - best linter/fixer out there. Can be configure for mutliple languages (and multiple
  fixer/linter for each). And most of all works asynchronously so it gives a really strong IDE-like
  feeling and functionality,
- fzf - fuzzy file finder. After using it for a while you would forget how to open files in other
  way that by using this plugin,
